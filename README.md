This is a Composer-based installer for the [Lightning](https://www.drupal.org/project/lightning) Drupal distribution. Welcome to the future!

## Get Started
```
$ composer create-project acquia/lightning-project MY_PROJECT
```
Composer will create a new directory called MY_PROJECT containing a ```docroot``` directory with a full Lightning code base therein. You can then install it like you would any other Drupal site.

## Maintenance
```drush make```, ```drush pm-download```, ```drush pm-update``` and their ilk are the old-school way of maintaining your code base. Forget them. You're in Composer land now!

Let this handy table be your guide:

| Task                                            | Drush                                         | Composer                                          |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Installing a contrib project (latest version)   | ```drush pm-download PROJECT```               | ```composer require drupal/PROJECT```         |
| Installing a contrib project (specific version) | ```drush pm-download PROJECT-8.x-1.0-beta3``` | ```composer require drupal/PROJECT:1.0.0-beta3``` |
| Updating all contrib projects and Drupal core   | ```drush pm-update```                         | ```composer update```                             |
| Updating a single contrib project               | ```drush pm-update PROJECT```                 | ```composer update drupal/PROJECT```              |
| Updating Drupal core                            | ```drush pm-update drupal```                  | ```composer update drupal/core```                 |

The magic is that Composer, unlike Drush, is a *dependency manager*. If module ```foo version: 1.0.0``` depends on ```baz version: 3.2.0```, Composer will not let you update baz to ```3.3.0``` (or downgrade it to ```3.1.0```, for that matter). Drush has no concept of dependency management. If you've ever accidentally hosed a site because of dependency issues like this, you've probably already realized how valuable Composer can be.

But to be clear: it is still very helpful to use a site management tool like Drush or Drupal Console. Tasks such as database updates (```drush updatedb```) are still firmly in the province of such utilities. This installer will install a copy of Drush (local to the project) in the ```bin``` directory.

### Specifying a version
you can specify a version from the command line with:

    $ composer require drupal/<modulename>:<version> 

For example:

    $ composer require drupal/ctools:3.0.0-alpha26
    $ composer require drupal/token:1.x-dev 

In these examples, the composer version 3.0.0-alpha26 maps to the drupal.org version 8.x-3.0-alpha26 and 1.x-dev maps to 8.x-1.x branch on drupal.org.

If you specify a branch, such as 1.x you must add -dev to the end of the version.

**Composer is only responsible for maintaining the code base**.

## Source Control
If you peek at the ```.gitignore``` we provide, you'll see that certain directories, including all directories containing contributed projects, are excluded from source control. This might be a bit disconcerting if you're newly arrived from Planet Drush, but in a Composer-based project like this one, **you SHOULD NOT commit your installed dependencies to source control**.

When you set up the project, Composer will create a file called ```composer.lock```, which is a list of which dependencies were installed, and in which versions. **Commit ```composer.lock``` to source control!** Then, when your colleagues want to spin up their own copies of the project, all they'll have to do is run ```composer install```, which will install the correct versions of everything in ```composer.lock```.
